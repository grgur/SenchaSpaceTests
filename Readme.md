Notes
=====
* In multiple app environment, working with workspaces and packages makes a lot of sense. Sencha Cmd 5 is to provide with workspace watch methods. Hopefully we won't have to build every app in the workspace individually.
* Creating a deployment script on server side is proven to be very helpful as my Sencha Space native app gets built updates automatically
* ~350ms is the delay between `launch()` and `onSpaceReady()` (on an iPad mini)


Questions:
============
* How to debug an app inside of Sencha Space? It's not showing up in Safari remote debugger
* It would be great if Space would check for app updates after pin entry. How often are the apps updated anyway?
